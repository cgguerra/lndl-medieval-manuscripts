## About LNDL Medieval Manuscripts

### Featured in the Collection

This collection showcases manuscripts from the Loyola Notre Dame Library archives. LNDL Medieval Manuscripts includes images of historiated initials, illuminated initials, and full page illustrations from the three medieval manuscripts featured in the library collection. The collection includes a 13th-century Italian quarto from a large Bible featuring Corinthians I and II and part of Galatians, a 15th-century Italian Book of Hours, and a 15th-century French Book of Hours. All three manuscripts were donated to Notre Dame by Father John Fletcher in the 1940s.

### About the Author

My name is Christina Guerra and I graduated from Loyola University Maryland in 2023 with a double major in Art History and Classical Civilization with minors in Spanish, Italian Studies, and Medieval Studies. As part of my 2023 Loyola Center for the Humanities Student Summer Fellowship "Researching Medieval Manuscripts at the LNDL," I completed a full codicological examination of both Books of Hours and the quarto, foliated all pages, researched imagery and regional saints, created a catalogue entry for all manuscripts, wrote an essay focusing on the images in the Italian manuscript, and created this website in an effort to make the manuscript illustrations more accessible to scholars. 

### Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my advisor and mentor Dr. Kerry Boeye of the Loyola Fine Arts Department for his professional expertise and support throughout this project. I would also like to thank Ms. Jennifer Kinniff and Mr. Peter Sutton from Archives for allowing me to view the manuscripts and for working with me throughout the research process. 

This website would not have been possible without Olivia Wikle, Devin Becker, and Evan Williamson and their session Building Digital Collections at Digital Humanities Summer Institute 2023.
